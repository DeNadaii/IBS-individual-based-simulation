# Individual-Based Simulation (IBS) Project

This is the README file for the Individual-Based Simulation (IBS) project. In this project, we are studying and implementing IBS algorithms to simulate the behavior and interactions of individuals within a population.

## What is IBS?

Individual-Based Simulation (IBS) refers to computational models that simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous individuals to assess their effects on the system as a whole. These simulations are particularly useful in fields like ecology, epidemiology, and social sciences, where the behavior of individuals can significantly influence the overall dynamics of the population.

## Project Description

The Individual-Based Simulation (IBS) project focuses on exploring and analyzing IBS algorithms. These models simulate the life cycles, behaviors, and interactions of individuals within a population, capturing the diversity and complexity of real-world systems. Our aim is to understand the principles behind IBS and apply these models to various scientific and practical problems.

In this project, we implement IBS using the Python programming language and leverage appropriate libraries and frameworks for simulation and visualization. The project encompasses the development of models for different scenarios, data analysis, and visualization of the simulation outcomes.
